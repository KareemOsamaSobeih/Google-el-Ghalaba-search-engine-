The European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre (EOWDC) is Scotland&#39;s largest offshore wind test and demonstration facility and represents an investment of more than £300 million. Developed by Vattenfall owned Aberdeen Offshore Wind Farm Limited along with supportive partner, Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group. The innovative 93.2MW, 11-turbine offshore wind scheme will trial next generation technology and is exporting the equivalent of 70% of Aberdeen&#39;s domestic electricity demand and 23% of Aberdeen&#39;s total demand to the National Grid.  In February 2019, a Scottish court ruled that Trump International Golf Club Scotland Ltd should pay legal costs incurred by the Scottish government during a years-long legal battle with the Trump club, which unsuccessfully sued to halt the wind farm project. The club, opened by Donald Trump in 2012, claimed the turbines would spoil the view from the seaside course.

His first penalty, in the first minute of the game, was saved, while the second he converted the loose ball after it was initially saved.[186]On 16 June 2019, Salah provided two assists after coming on as a substitute in 3–1 win over Guinea in friendly warm-up game for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations on home soil, wearing the captain's armband for the first time ever at his international career.[187] On 26 June, Salah scored his first goal of the tournament in Egypt's second group match, a 2–0 win over DR Congo; he was also involved in the opening goal of the match, which was scored by captain Ahmed Elmohamady.[188]A quick, mobile, hard-working and tactical player, with good technique and an eye for goal, Salah is predominantly known for his speed, movement, clinical finishing, agility, dribbling skills, first touch, and ball control, as well as his ability to use both his pace and flair on the ball in order to beat opponents, and create scoring opportunities for himself or his teammates.[189][190][191][192][193] A versatile forward, he primarily plays as a winger on the right flank, a position which allows him to cut into the centre onto his stronger left foot, and either shoot on goal or play quick exchanges with other players and make runs in behind the defence towards goal; he can also play in the centre behind the main striker as either an attacking midfielder or second striker.[194]On his increased threat in front of goal since joining Liverpool, Salah credits Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp’s request for him to occupy more advanced central positions, often operating as a main striker, with the forward telling ESPN, ""I play closer to the goal than any club before.""[189][190][195] Salah initially started his career at the left-back position, however, following a 4–0 win over the youth team of Egyptian club ENPPI, Salah was in tears for not scoring after missing several clear chances; this made his coach realize his passion for scoring goals, forcing him to move him to a forward position.[196][197]While playing Al Mokawloon, American soccer coach Bob Bradley saw Salah play and noted his prodigious speed, explosiveness, and intelligence on the pitch, already evident at his young age.[198] Upon signing for Chelsea, José Mourinho said of Salah: ""He's young, he's fast, he's creative, he's enthusiastic. When we analysed him he looks the kind of humble personality on the pitch, ready to work for the team.""[199] Mourinho added that Salah has ""similar qualities"" with ""talented players"" that he had worked with, such as Gareth Bale and Arjen Robben.[200] His technical skills, pace, left foot, goalscoring, position and direct playing style led him to be nicknamed the ""Egyptian Messi"", in the Italian media.[201][202] Brazilian World Cup winner Ronaldo – whom Salah idolized while growing up – stated, ""Salah is an incredible player with a tremendous quality. He looks like Messi.""[203][204] Salah has also received praise for having never celebrated scoring a goal against any of his former clubs.[205]Mohamed Salah and his wife, Maggi, married in 2013. Their daughter, Makka, born in 2014,[206] is named in honour of the Islamic holy city of Mecca.[198] He had another daughter, Kayan, born in 2020.[207] Salah is Muslim and celebrates goals by performing the sujud.[208] On this goal celebration, Salah told CNN, ""It's something like praying or thanking God for what I have received, but yeah, it's just praying and praying for a win. [I've] always done that since I was young, everywhere.""[209]Salah features in EA Sports' FIFA video game series: on FIFA 18 he had a rating of 87 and a potential of 90 following his displays for Liverpool.[210] In a 2018 poll by FIFPLAY, a website run and made for the game's fans, Salah ranked first (ahead of Lionel Messi) on who should be the global cover star for FIFA 19, obtaining 77 percent of the total number of votes.[211]Active on social media, Salah has over 30 million Instagram followers, the most for a person from Egypt.[212][213]Salah has a sponsorship deal with sportswear and equipment supplier Adidas: he wears Adidas X18 football boots.[214] He appeared in an Adidas 2018 World Cup commercial along with other players in the Adidas stable, including David Beckham, Lionel Messi and Paul Pogba, and singer Pharrell Williams.[215]In March 2018, Salah appeared in an advertisement for Vodafone Egypt. Filmed visiting several Merseyside landmarks, the video was originally released in Arabic (but was also translated to English).[216]Salah is active in regeneration projects in Nagrig, his hometown where 65% of people live in poverty, donating money to help build a school and hospital.[217][218] The project includes the construction of an Al-Azhar institute and an ambulance unit. In an interview with Al-Masry Al-Youm, father of the Egyptian footballer Salah Ghaly, claimed that his son refused to accept any financial assistance with the project.[219]During his time in Egypt, Salah's family was once robbed, however, the thief was caught and arrested by police, with Salah's father preparing to press charges against him, but Mohamed convinced him to drop the case. Afterwards, Salah helped the thief financially, giving him some money and trying to find him a job.[220] In February 2018, following a match against Tottenham, Salah donated a replica shirt to young supporter Mohamed Abdel Karim, who was previously pictured wearing a jumper reading Salah's name and shirt number.[221] Moreover, Mohamed Salah has helped more than 450 families by giving them monthly allowances and he also helped the government by giving approximately $300,000 when the country was in a bad situation.[222]On 30 July 2013, while playing for Basel in a UEFA Champions League qualifying match against Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv, Salah appeared to have refused to shake hands with several of the club's Israeli players, and instead appeared to have preoccupied himself with changing his boots at the side of the pitch during the ceremony. His club maintained afterwards that it had been a ""coincidence"" and that no snub had been intended. In the return leg on 6 July played in Tel Aviv, instead of offering an open hand Salah appeared to have only offered fist bumps to the Maccabi players. He was booed by the home fans for the rest of the match, in which he scored once as Basel progressed into the next round.[223][224]Prior to 2018 FIFA World Cup, Salah condemned the Egyptian FA unauthorised use of his image on the national team's EgyptAir plane.[225] At the 2018 FIFA World Cup, at which the Egypt national team were based in Chechnya, the autonomous republic presided by Ramzan Kadyrov, Salah posed for a photo with the Chechen leader after the latter made a visit to the team's hotel and requested a photo shoot with him at the stadium during their team training.[226] Kadyrov later gave him honorary citizenship of the Chechen Republic in a public dinner made for the whole Egypt national team and officials.[227] Several western news outlets and NGOs criticised Salah and the EFA for their interactions with Kadyrov, citing the president's alleged human rights abuses and that the player is used for 'political propaganda' by the dictator during Egypt's national team training camp in Chechnya.[228][229] Salah's relationship with the Egyptian Football Association (EFA) was reported to have soured during the World Cup, after his image was used without his permission to promote the national team's sponsor, WE, the mobile service of Telecom Egypt.[230] At the time of the incident, Salah was sponsored by WE's telecommunications rivals, Vodafone.[231]In August 2018, Liverpool referred Salah to Merseyside police after footage was posted online which showed him allegedly using a phone while driving in traffic.[232][233][234] Salah's indiscretion was brought to light after autograph hunter Rob Wylie posted a video online apparently showing the Egyptian ignoring requests for autographs. Wylie, whose conduct had previously resulted in Liverpool instituting a policy which banned players giving autographs from their vehicles, received widespread criticism from the club's supporters and had to temporarily shut down his website.[235][236]Liverpool fans created a chant to the tune of Dodgy's ""Good Enough"", saying that if Salah continued to score goals, they would convert to Islam – ""If he's good enough for you, he's good enough for me, if he scores another few, then I'll be Muslim too.""[237] Salah gave his approval to the chant, and it has been cited as an example of inclusivity.[238] Salah is devout to a degree that many other well-known Muslims sports figures are not, and his charm and apolitical persona have made him a popular figure in the UK.[198] During his goal celebration, Salah lays in the prostrate position to thank god in sujud.[239] It appears in FIFA 19.[240]Salah is nicknamed ""The Pharaoh"" by the press and his fans.[241][242][243] Salah was given the nickname ""Egyptian King"" by Liverpool supporters,[244][245] arising from a chant set to the tune of ""Sit Down"" by English band James.[246]Following his goal that led Egypt to the World Cup finals for the first time since 1990, a school in Egypt was named after him.[247] Following Egypt's exit from the World Cup, Salah stayed in his home country for his pre-season holiday. In late June, his address was accidentally leaked on Facebook. After this, crowds of fans showed up at Salah's house, with Salah greeting the fans and signing autographs for some, although according to reports in Spain, police did arrive to cordon off his house.[248]During Liverpool's pre-season tour in the U.S. an American artist named Brandan Odums created a mural in the Times Square area displaying Salah in the Egypt kit, with the player later posting an image on social media posing next to it.[249][250] In Egypt, several murals have also been created displaying Salah's likeness, including one in the capital of Cairo.[251][252]A testament to his influence in the region and globally, Salah was featured on the cover of two major magazines in 2018: GQ Middle East (feature story titled ""The Unstoppable Rise of Mo Salah"")[253] and Time magazine's 2019 TIME 100 edition.[254] An advocate of women's equality in the Middle East, Salah (in his TIME 100 entry) states, ""We need to change the way we treat women in our culture"".[255] English comedian, and noted Liverpool fan, John Oliver wrote Salah's feature in the TIME 100 issue.[254] Despite being named as the ""GQ Middle East Man of The Year"" in 2019, another GQ photoshoot, with Brazilian model Alessandra Ambrosio, caused him some criticism in the Islamic world.[256] In January 2020, Salah was honored with wax statue at Madame Tussauds in London. The museum announced that the statue would be unveiled later in the year. “As Egyptian Forward and currently both European and World Club champion with Liverpool FC, Mo Salah is a global star at the peak of his power. We know that fans will love seeing him at the home of celebrity, where he rightly belongs,” Steve Davies, General Manager at Madame Tussauds in London said.[257]BaselLiverpoolEgypt U20Egypt U23EgyptIndividualEnglandLiverpoolEgyptItaly^p^","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Mohamed_Salah_2018.jpg/200px-Mohamed_Salah_2018.jpg@@::;;@@;Mohamed Salah 2018.jpg@@::;;@@;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Zenit-bazel_2013_%282%29.jpg/170px-Zenit-bazel_2013_%282%29.jpg@@::;;@@; @@::;;@@;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Mohamed_Salah_with_Chelsea_-_Jan_2015.jpg/150px-Mohamed_Salah_with_Chelsea_-_Jan_2015.jpg@@::;;@@; @@::;;@@;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Mohamed_Salah_2015.jpg/170px-Mohamed_Salah_2015.jpg@@::;;@@; @@::;;@@;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Mohamed_Salah_2017.jpg/170px-Mohamed_Salah_2017.jpg@@::;;@@; @@::;;@@;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Mo_Salah_2018_%28cropped%29.jpg/170px-Mo_Salah_2018_%28cropped%29.jpg@@::;;@@; @@::;;@@;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/LFC_Parade_2019_03.jpg/220px-LFC_Parade_2019_03.jpg@@::;;@@; @@::;;@@;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Mo_Salah_in_UEFA_Super_Cup_2019.jpg/220px-Mo_Salah_in_UEFA_Super_Cup_2019.jpg@@::;;@@; @@::;;@@;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Mo_Salah_2018.png/185px-Mo_Salah_2018.png@@::;;@@; @@::;;@@;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Mohamed_Salah_Ghaly.jpg/160px-Mohamed_Salah_Ghaly.jpg@@::;;@@; @@::;;@@;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Salah_in_press_conference_-_CAF_Awards_2017.jpg/220px-Salah_in_press_conference_-_CAF_Awards_2017.jpg@@::;;@@; @@::;;@@;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Salah_Graffiti_in_Cairo.jpg/170px-Salah_Graffiti_in_Cairo.jpg@@::;;@@; @@::;;@@;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Liverpool_vs._Chelsea%2C_UEFA_Super_Cup_2019-08-14_57.jpg/220px-Liverpool_vs._Chelsea%2C_UEFA_Super_Cup_2019-08-14_57.jpg@@::;;@@; @@::;;@@;","1970-01-01","--","2020-05-25 21:56:41"
